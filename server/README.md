# GraphQL Server with Authentication & Permissions

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with an email-password-based authentication workflow and authentication rules**, based on Prisma, [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga), [graphql-shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield) & [GraphQL Nexus](https://graphql-nexus.com/).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Install Node dependencies:

```
yarn
```

### 2. Launch Prisma with Docker

This example is based on Docker. If you don't have Docker installed, you can get it from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community). Use the Docker Compose CLI to launch the Docker containers specified in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml):

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Set up database & deploy Prisma datamodel

To deploy the datamodel for this example, run the following command:

```
yarn prisma deploy
```

You can now use [Prisma Admin](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-admin/overview-el3e/) to view and edit your data by appending `/_admin` to your Prisma endpoint.

### 4. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
yarn start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).
